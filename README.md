kurodot.io: AI-Powered Phygital Curation Engine
kurodot.io is a high-performance spatial engine designed to bridge the gap between physical sculptures and digital twins. By leveraging Gemini 3, Three.js, and real-time telemetry, we transform static 3D galleries into intelligent, reactive exhibition environments.

🚀 The Vision: Beyond Static Curation
Established in late 2025, this project was inspired by the challenge of finding physical venues to showcase complex sculptures. kurodot.io allows physical artifacts to live on as high-fidelity digital twins while preserving their "spatial weight" through advanced lighting and physics.

🧠 Gemini 3 Integration
We use Gemini 3 Flash as a "Reasoning Engine" for spatial computing. The integration focuses on:

Multimodal Curation: Gemini 3 analyzes the geometric properties of 3D assets to suggest optimal lighting presets and spatial coordinates automatically.

Behavioral Synthesis: By processing real-time telemetry data (tracked via Umami), Gemini 3 generates natural language reports for curators, identifying high-engagement focus zones.

🛠️ The "Vibe Coding" Tech Stack
3D Core: Three.js with Draco geometry compression and WebP textures for instant loading and high-fidelity rendering.

AI Engine: Gemini 3 Flash for automated curatorial logic and reasoning.

Real-time Infrastructure: Firebase for identity management and Pusher for millisecond-latency interaction streaming.

Telemetry & Analytics: Umami for privacy-first behavioral tracking without intrusive cookies.

3D Modeling: Tripo 3D for transforming physical references into digital twins.

✨ Key Features
Interactive Controls: Toggle real-time community Ranking, realistic Gravity, and dynamic Lighting environments.

Atmospheric Scenes: Over 20+ procedurally generated environments, from Solar Flare to Moonlight Sonata, driven by AI-suggested moods.

One-Line Deployment: Integrate high-fidelity 3D museums into any website with a single iframe snippet.
