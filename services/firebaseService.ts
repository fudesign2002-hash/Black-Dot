 * NOTE: Hotspot tracking functionality was intentionally removed on 2025-12-12.
 * This file is retained as a placeholder location for any future hotspot
 * re-implementation. Currently there are no active hotspot functions in the
 * repository; search for "hotspot" to locate references (the repo contains
 * only comments that mention removal).
 *
 * If you decide to re-enable hotspot tracking, restore the previous
 * implementation from version control or implement the APIs your app expects,
 * for example:
 *   - updateHotspotPoint(zoneId: string, worldX: number, worldZ: number, points: number)
 *   - updateArtworkHotspotLikes(artworkId: string, points: number)
 *
 * This file intentionally exports harmless stubs to avoid runtime errors if
 * another module accidentally imports it during development.
